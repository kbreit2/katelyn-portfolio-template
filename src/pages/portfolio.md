# Portfolio

This page details the design process for my portfolio:

## Navigation

I chose to kept most of the navigational structures that were built into the Docusaurus template. This was both a practical choice, as I'd be fighting against the template to restucture it, and a preferential choice, as I'd grown accustomed to the existing structure and found it sensible to categorize all the requirements.

The most major addition was adding a new tag, Studies, to the blog to capture the assignments that belonged on the blog page, but did not suit any of the reading reflection frameworks.

Aside from that, I consistently tagged reading reflection blog posts so they can be filtered by their framework. I also kept dating the blog posts, so they're ordered chronologically.

## Accessibility
Orange is a difficult color scheme to pull off from a contrast standpoint. I ran Lighthouse tests in attempt to tweak the colors. It was important to me that at least one of the color modes pass the tests consistently, so I directed those efforts toward dark mode as the Lighthouse tests were yielding inconsistent results between pages for light mode. This is the Lighthouse result for the homepage:

I was also careful to include alt text on the images within my site. Keyboard-friendly controls were mostly built into the Docusaurus template, but I was careful to account for them when adding new elements, such as the carousel back and forth buttons on the home page. Whenever other miscallaneous Lighthouse warnings popped up, I took efforts to address them if they were within the scope of changes that could be made to the template. This usually came down to small things like adding titles to certain HTML elements.

## Usability
usability elements to help make content easier to digest (bulleted lists, pagination, expandable blocks, headings, etc.)

## Evolution

## Value Integration
For the sake of my portfolio, I chose to focus on the values of self-expression and learning. Self-expression, for me, came through simply by having fun with the portfolio. Many of the portfolio examples I'd seen were very minimalistic in nature, and while the clean look of this is a good way to convey professionality, I feel they often lose personality in the process. I consider myself to have a good amount of range in design, and while I'm capable of sleeker designs of that nature, they aren't how I'd choose to present myself. So, I went with a bold color scheme and used the opportunity to hand-make the graphics shown on the home page. I also valued learning, which is a value fairly built in to the structure of this portfolio, where things like reading exercises and my takeaways are documented. But beyond that, I wanted to convey the learning theme through the site's visual identity, hence the desk theming on the homepage.
