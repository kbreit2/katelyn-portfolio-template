The readability of font is a crucial visual consideration, achieved by ensuring a font is suitably large and favoring sans serif fonts as a way to prevent issues of clarity at lower resolutions. Images are also emphasized as an important way to draw attention to a message. Labels tell much of the story behind a photo, and styling your photo in a harmonious way with the rest of the "slide" creates a more appealing and effective visual.

Home pages are emphasized as a way to serve users with an overview of crucial information quickly, and taglines are also endorsed as a way to be upfront with a website's goals. So, to encapsulate all the takeaways from these readings, I decided to sketch a UI that would touch on several of them. I began by choosing a random image from my camera roll to serve as a banner, and ended up with one of a butterfly. From this, I decided that the website would be a butterfly identification database.
