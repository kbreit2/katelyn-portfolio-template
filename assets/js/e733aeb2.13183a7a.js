Inclusive design can be a tricky problem since not all users have the same needs, and something that may be useful to one person might actively disrupt another. This issue, along with the time and resources involved in making a website widely accessible, are commonly blamed for why designers don't pursue accessibility options. But in modern design, where we have conveniences like accessibility menus that allow people to customize the features that best assist their experince, there's little need to attempt to respond to everyone's needs in a singular interface. By including different options to adjust the same base experience, we can allow users to individualize their experience."]}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Creating these options does still take resources on the designers' part, but it is a worthy effort to allow the most people possible to use a site comfortably. If enough people are willing to undertake that effort, we can make a more widely accessible internet, and perhaps contribute to even more tools along the way that can make accessibility features simpler to implement. The amount of accessibility-related resources readily available to developers has already increased greatly from the past. Krug offers easy starting points, like fixing widespread use issues, doing research on accessible web design, and starting with small things like alt text, clear heading structure, and color contrast to fix a few common accessibility issues."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Sources:"}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["Krug, S.
