But I was more surprised by the unspoken undertone of many of those principles: being able to present and expand your perspective. A successful interview should be able to tell the interviewer what kind of person you would be to work with. Being able to articulate how you think, your process, and challenges you've overcome is a good way to illustrate your adaptability, and how they could expect you to respond to similar situations in their work environment. Being self-reflective, and demonstrating that you've been able to progress and learn from your mistakes is also valued--many interviewees get too caught up in fear of presenting themself as capable of mistakes to convey this effectively. And illustrating that same curiosity, building your perspective of what your work experience would be like if you were hired, is not just good for your own understanding, but is often appreciated by interviewers who want to see your passion and thoughtfulness about the position; they want you to want the job, and that usually requires a deep understanding of what that job truly means."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Videos:"}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)("ul",{children:[(0,i.jsx)("li",{children:(0,i.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j07li1MUIa4",children:"Ricardo Hernandez Perez"})}),(0,i.jsx)("li",{children:(0,i.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu3xcQm7cEo",children:"CareerFoundry"})}),(0,i.jsx)("li",{children:(0,i.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtN3yHIWuRY",children:"DesignWithArash"})})]}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,i.jsx)(t.img,{alt:"An interviewer and interviewee sit across from each other.
