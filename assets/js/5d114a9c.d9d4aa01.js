I had primarily worked on platforms that were not made with artists in mind, where I struggled with visibility and a lack of tailored features. Ealynn had this experience as well, in addition to some knowledge of emerging artist-centric platforms like Cara that didn't offer the same quality as traditional platforms.

We also hoped to provide tools to artists to help from a business standpoint, such as ordering and managing commission work\u2013-which would naturally be absent from apps not catered toward artists.

Our specific values for the project, creativity and harmony, were especially informative to our color choices. We briefly considered orange, as its energetic qualities and creative associations felt apt for a social platform for artists. But, we ultimately landed on purple as our core color. This retained the creative associations, but had a calmer and more elegant feeling than orange. I also valued the symbolic use of purple, as it is a largely man-made conception of color\u2013-it felt like the perfect fit for our app that hoped to be a celebration of human creativity.
