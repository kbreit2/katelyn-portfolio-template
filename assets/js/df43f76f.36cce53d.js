I chose to design this like a poster, or the concept art for what could be developed into one. I broke the drawing up into color zones where, in words, I wrote the associations of the respective color. For the personal color related information, I summarized the suggestions into a quick character drawing to accompany each section of the diagram, where the expression and pose of the character aim to convey what the reading suggests are characteristics of fans of the color.
