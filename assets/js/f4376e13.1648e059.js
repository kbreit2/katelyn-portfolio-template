This term is especially relevant to the section on Human-Centered Design, but I believe it\u2019s also a common thread among the design principles described in the entire chapter. A well-designed object is easy to use, with its intended affordances and the means to achieve those affordances signified without much conscious effort on the user's part. Many designs fail to be immediately understandable by a user, such as the Norman doors the author describes that lack common cues such as handles or visible hinges. Adding signifiers may help to fill gaps in a user\u2019s intuition. Understanding what makes sense to human users allows for a product to serve its purpose in a streamlined manner. This concept is crucial to remember in my career in design because a design that is not intuitive risks losing the patience and favor of its users, without whom a product is useless. Making a product easy to use elevates the user's experience and can provide an edge over competing products that may not have taken the user\u2019s intuitive behaviors and assumptions into consideration. Where well-chosen embellishments may make a user\u2019s experience actively positive, intuitive ones should ensure it isn\u2019t negative."]}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["Source: Norman, D.
