<p>Interviews are a notoriously daunting process for many, especially those just starting out in an industry or any professional environment. To summarize the process in a single word, with all the preparation and knowledge that goes into a successful interview, is a difficult task. But in the context of a design interview, I believe perspective is the single most important concept to consider.</p>
<p>After watching these three videos from people with experience in the design industry, and seeing their advice for interviewees, I was unsurprised by many of the common threads: being self-aware, articulate, concise, and simply prepared were clearly emphasized. But I was more surprised by the unspoken undertone of many of those principles: being able to present and expand your perspective. A successful interview should be able to tell the interviewer what kind of person you would be to work with. Being able to articulate how you think, your process, and challenges you&#x27;ve overcome is a good way to illustrate your adaptability, and how they could expect you to respond to similar situations in their work environment. Being self-reflective, and demonstrating that you&#x27;ve been able to progress and learn from your mistakes is also valued--many interviewees get too caught up in fear of presenting themself as capable of mistakes to convey this effectively. And illustrating that same curiosity, building your perspective of what your work experience would be like if you were hired, is not just good for your own understanding, but is often appreciated by interviewers who want to see your passion and thoughtfulness about the position; they want you to want the job, and that usually requires a deep understanding of what that job truly means.</p>

<p>Though design interviews may have their own procedures outside of this stereotypical interview setup, the core principle of presenting oneself and being able to have a productive conversation with the interviewer remains.

For the exercise, each member of the group was assigned a certain population, and tasked with researching and presenting their accessibility needs. Afterwards, the group would negotiate and prioritize the design requirements derived from these needs, and allocate a set amount of resources on which could be implemented into our hypothetical web design.</p>
<p>My group was color vision deficiency (CVD), better known as color blindness.</p>
<p>You can view the full presentation here:</p>
<table><iframe title="UIUN Color Vision Deficiency Presentation" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQ_6IVo7bonuABM50WZpxqvO0CMDc2XcWpeGLnNnFCHR8CXKieSt1bgRTjhfhcewHrY-3igWzkPsKLc/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=30000" frameborder="0" width="960" height="569" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe></table>
<p>My initial findings were that:</p>
<ul><li>CVD affects 4.5% of the population, or 300 million people globally.</li><li><p>There are many different types of CVD, which affect color perception differently.</p><ul><li>Most commonly, CVD affects the ability to discriminate between red and green.</li><li>Other types include tritanopia, which affects yellow vs pink, red vs purple, and blue vs green.</li><li>In rare cases, and associated with more significant visual impairments, someone may be completely unable to see in color.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>4.5% is a large number when we&#x27;re talking about a group that could potentially be excluded by poor design decisions. But, with the varying types of CVD, it was clear not everyone with it has the same experience--and, by extension, a solution that worked for one person with CVD would be unlikely to work for the entire population. What we needed was:</p>
<ul><li>Not to focus too much on the hues in use, since not everyone will perceive them the same way.</li><li>To focus on making design elements distinct, regardless of what hue they were perceived to be.</li><li>To give some additional cue if color is used to imply meaning.</li></ul>
<p>These principles translate fairly immediately into design ideas:</p>
<ul><li>Use additional, <em>meaningful</em> symbols, labels, etc. to accompany color cues.</li><li>Make sure the values of our colors contrast enough, so that regardless of the parent hue, they are clearly differentiated.</li></ul>
<p>I once spent several minutes trying to piece together why my code, which had compiled and was working as expected, had a red parentheses, the color that usually indicates a syntax error. After coming up with nothing, I eventually discovered that what I had perceived as read was simply a magenta color that appeared red due to my low screen brightness--it was simply meant to color code a match with its closing parentheses. Sufficient contrast, or an additional symbol besides color, could have avoided the confusion entirely. I don&#x27;t have CVD, and I could readily think of an instance where I would benefit from the same design changes that could help someone who does.</p>
<p>This revealed a strong underlying theme of this exercise. Inclusive design ideas don&#x27;t exclusively help people with disabilities--they&#x27;re often good considerations in general, helping a wide range of users beyond just the ones they were built for. For that reason, I was optimistic about the support I&#x27;d receive for my changes going into the negotiation process with my peers. I planned to emphasize color contrast within the values of the palette, since I expected non-color signifiers would not require much argument. I was prompt about prioritizing this aspect of the palette, and with a few additional requirements for colors or color combinations to favor or avoid being wrapped into the original (many of which came from our photosensitivity representative), I was able to secure both my major design suggestions here.</p>
<p>Overall, the negotiations went very smoothly. My peers seemed very mindful of the importance of all the design considerations presented, even ones that did not directly assist their population. I was most surprised by the overlap between myself and the non-native English speakers representative, as at first glance there wouldn&#x27;t appear to be much overlap between CVD and multilingual populations. However, acknowledging that many multilingual users are going to have different cultural backgrounds, it brought up the important consideration that the meanings of colors are not universal. People with CVD may miss color-indicated meanings due to a difference in how they perceive the colors, and people with different cultural backgrounds than a designer may miss the meaning because they have a different association with the color. For both, use of additional cues to suggest the content&#x27;s meaning would be beneficial. As for the groups that were hardest to convince, our representative of baby boomers diverged the most vocally from me. Though there were some places our populations&#x27; needs overlapped, such as having good color contrast, the areas where their needs diverged took many of our priorities elsewhere. She was advocating for things like screen reader support over something like non color-dependent cues.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that either of us acknowledge the usefulness of the other&#x27;s proposals, but with the limited resources we had to allocate to our final picks, our priorities conflicted. I felt bad about ignoring the suggestions of many others whose proposals did not match well with mine, or who had less support for their suggestions overall. Not a single one of my peers&#x27; ideas were without purpose, and all would be helpful inclusions for accessibility. It seems to match many common trends in web design overall, where the less visible accessibility requirements go neglected--and, thanks to that lack of accesibility, it&#x27;s not always simple for those populations to voice their needs to the people who could make these changes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this exercise gave me a lot to think about, and many principles to carry into my future designs. My major takeaways from the activity were:</p>

<p><em>Constraints are to design as laws are to society.</em></p>
<p>The many constraints we place within a design are a powerful tool in conveying how it is used. As Norman elaborates in this chapter, laws themselves are a form of cultural constraint.</p>
<p>Physical constraints limit what can be physically done with a thing, such as inserting an object into something or connecting two objects at a specific point. These are a useful way to deter incorrect actions and imply the correct ones, especially when they are clearly communicated, which can be done even in simple ways like through an object&#x27;s physical structure.</p>
<p>Cultural constraints refer to the limits of our thinking within a cultural context. Some behaviors or symbols might be commonplace in one part of the world, but mean nothing at all, or something entirely different, in others. Cultural constraints limit a user&#x27;s ability to interact with something, and may also limit a designer&#x27;s ability to think about the universality of a design.</p>
<p>Semantic constraints refer to the context of a situation. Given the context and ultimate goals of an individual design, some operations may be more intuitive than they would be in another context.</p>
<p>Logical constraints are deductions a user can make, such as pieces of text going with the most adjacent heading.</p>
<p>All these constraints in total provide order to a design, but they can be difficult to balance, and due to their lack of universality can create accessibility issues as not all users will understand them the same way. Thus, it is important for any designer to have an understanding of how a wide variety of users will process different constraints.</p>

<p><em>Options</em> is a word that embodies the concepts of this chapter. Inclusive design can be a tricky problem since not all users have the same needs, and something that may be useful to one person might actively disrupt another. This issue, along with the time and resources involved in making a website widely accessible, are commonly blamed for why designers don&#x27;t pursue accessibility options. But in modern design, where we have conveniences like accessibility menus that allow people to customize the features that best assist their experince, there&#x27;s little need to attempt to respond to everyone&#x27;s needs in a singular interface. By including different options to adjust the same base experience, we can allow users to individualize their experience.</p>
<p>Creating these options does still take resources on the designers&#x27; part, but it is a worthy effort to allow the most people possible to use a site comfortably. If enough people are willing to undertake that effort, we can make a more widely accessible internet, and perhaps contribute to even more tools along the way that can make accessibility features simpler to implement. The amount of accessibility-related resources readily available to developers has already increased greatly from the past. Krug offers easy starting points, like fixing widespread use issues, doing research on accessible web design, and starting with small things like alt text, clear heading structure, and color contrast to fix a few common accessibility issues.</p>

<p>These readings go into depth on the nature of user testing, and the nature of mistakes within a UI.</p>
<p><em>Don’t Make Me Think</em> covers the benefits and general flow of user testing. User testing allows us to gain insights from people with distance from the project–the designers, too used to their own system, can easily overlook issues entirely, leading to problems if they assume this means no issues remain. User testing does not need to be expensive, or even especially formal beyond following a general script and gaining consent for recording. Generally, the user will be told about the process, introduced to the home page, then given tasks to attempt on the site. The proctor will watch them perform these tasks, and the user will attempt to narrate their thought process, so that we can better understand what goes through the user’s mind as they navigate (or fail to) through the task.</p>
<p><em>The Design of Everyday Things</em> gives us some guidance on how we should respond to user mistakes that were identified in testing. It is very rarely (but not never) the fault of a human when an error occurs. In most cases, were we to improve our design by giving better signifiers or feedback, accounting for possible mistakes, and so on, we could have prevented the error entirely. User testing allows us to uncover such mistakes and adjust our system accordingly.</p>
<p>This section got me thinking about a design consideration that has been more in the public eye recently–the shift to digital UI in cars. Concerns have been expressed both by the public and regulatory agencies about the safety of digital interfaces, which draw users’ attention away from the road for more sustained periods than a traditional car function, like a knob to change speaker volume, is expected to.</p>
<p>Tesla has been at the forefront of digitizing vehicles. I referenced the images in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxEteR7myno" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video</a> to analyze their UI. The UI does retain many established signifiers of analog interfaces, such as the speaker icons to indicate where volume controls are located and heating icons for temperature adjustment. However, aside from the basic functionalities of a car, it is difficult to guess where more advanced functions would be tucked away. The same argument could be made for a traditional interface, but due to the all-inclusive nature of the screen display, I suspect many users would be inclined to spend more time searching than they would parsing traditional buttons or knobs.</p>
<p>The video also references Elon Musk’s idea that all inputs are a mistake, which seems like a radical expansion on the ideas expressed in <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em> that it is rarely a human user’s fault when something goes wrong, but an underlying flaw in the system. Musk’s idea is something more akin to any dependency on human interaction is an error in the system. Making a system operate as independently from a user as possible would remove the human error excuse, but it will also unveil the flaws within the system itself.</p>

<p>This set of readings covered a lot of ground when it came to considerations for a UI design. <em>Presentation Zen</em> discusses typography and images in these chapters. The readability of font is a crucial visual consideration, achieved by ensuring a font is suitably large and favoring sans serif fonts as a way to prevent issues of clarity at lower resolutions. Images are also emphasized as an important way to draw attention to a message. Labels tell much of the story behind a photo, and styling your photo in a harmonious way with the rest of the &quot;slide&quot; creates a more appealing and effective visual. <em>Don&#x27;t Make Me Think</em> is a bit more diversified in its approach, discussing both the importance of communication within a UI. Home pages are emphasized as a way to serve users with an overview of crucial information quickly, and taglines are also endorsed as a way to be upfront with a website&#x27;s goals. So, to encapsulate all the takeaways from these readings, I decided to sketch a UI that would touch on several of them. I began by choosing a random image from my camera roll to serve as a banner, and ended up with one of a butterfly. From this, I decided that the website would be a butterfly identification database. I added a tagline and broadcast the name of the site in a large, sans serif font for readability. A drop shadow around the white text ensures it doesn&#x27;t fade into the background of the image.</p>

<p>For this reading, I chose to represent InVision&#x27;s discussion on helpful feedback in a concept map, to help relate their ideas of good feedback and how feedback can get lost if not given properly and constructively. Two major types of feedback are identified: redirecting and reinforcing. As the names imply, redirecting feedback tell people what they can improve on, while reinforcing feedback tells them where they are already successful. Feedback is a delicate thing, as poorly-done feedback is perceived as criticism, and results in a less open exchange of ideas. Feedback is crucial to helping designers learn and improve, and being cognizant of these principles helps maximize the effectiveness of the feedback we provide. We often aren&#x27;t aware of our own shortcomings, and our successes can often go unaddressed, so hearing about both helps keep us engaged.</p>

<p><em>Design is to a UI as clothes are to a person.</em></p>
<p>A person&#x27;s choice of fashion says a lot about them. Colors and styles convey detail about the wearer&#x27;s personality and, in many professional contexts, determines if someone is taken seriously and if they&#x27;re perceived to be taking the situation seriously. Since clothing is one of the first impressions we have of someone we&#x27;re meeting, it tends to be emphasized greatly. Many of the same principles apply to UI. Color conveyances, typefaces, and so on are used to style a UI in a way that conveys something about the people behind it. It seems a common trend in UXfolio&#x27;s collection of portfolio examples that many of them follow modern design conventions: sleek, clean, minimal in their palette, with splashes of color according to the designer&#x27;s own tastes. Since a portfolio is used in professional contexts, and in many cases is a prospective employer&#x27;s first impression of an applicant, it makes sense that these conventions emerge. It&#x27;s much the same idea as wearing business attire to a job interview--it&#x27;s an acknowledgement of the professional environment by following an established standard for that environment. Balancing a glimpse into the designer&#x27;s character with the professional expectations of the format can be a difficult task, but when done with intentionality and moderation, a portfolio can have both professionalism and personality.</p>

<p><em>Hierarchy</em> is a word that embodies both the navigation and values components of this reading.</p>
<p>Krug’s discussion of navigation heavily emphasizes hierarchy. It is crucial for a viewer to know where they are within a site, an especially difficult task given the relative unknowns of navigating a website compared to a physical environment. Thus, hierarchy helps direct where users are and where they can get to from that point. Users’ choices when navigating a website are usually snap judgments with little conscious thought, so helping to inform those by providing a visual indicator of the organization flow of the website can lead to more accurate choices and less opportunities to get lost. Several of Krug’s major questions to ask about website navigation, including the page’s major sections, options at the current level, and position in the scheme of things, are logically embodied by a hierarchy, and a UI is well-served by reflecting that internal logic through its visual construction.</p>
<p>Hierarchy is also important in conversations of values. Colin Breck describes the likely problem that a company will resonate with many core values, but must limit its key values in order to adhere to them fully. Specifically, the text describes “second-tier” values that are encompassed within the two core values selected by a company.</p>

<p>A simple image to represent hierarchy.
