# User Testing
## Reading from Steven Krug's *Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability* Pages 137-141

For this quick reading on debriefing user testing from Steven Krug’s *Don’t Make Me Think*, I thought it best to summarize the contents in a tutorial. This reading was about what comes after user testing, when we can take the information gained from the test back to the design team and plan next steps.

<ol>
<li>Create a list of nine problems observed during user testing, choosing three to offer to the group per session.</li>
<ol><li>Krug directs this advice at design teams: for smaller projects, offer up more of these problems at a time.</li></ol>
<li>Consider the cost-benefits of each issue to discern which are most critical for the most return.
Think about modifications before new features.</li>
<ol>
<li>Issues a user could self-correct are generally not of the highest priority.</li>
<li>Rank the most crucial problems from the collective list.</li>
</ol>
<li>Move forward with the top ten issues off the list.</li>
<li>Keep track of quick-fixes that did not make the top ten.</li>
<li>Make individual plans with the team as to how these issues will be approached.</li>
</ol>
