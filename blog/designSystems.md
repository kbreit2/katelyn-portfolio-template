# Design Systems
## Readings from Figma

*Restraint is to design systems as menus are to restaurants.*

The overarching theme of these articles is the importance of restraint in design systems. Keeping things simple may lead to sacrificing levels of detail that may seem undesirable at the time, but will make for easier management of the system moving forward. The more prescriptive the options are, the easier the rules are to follow, and the easier it is to make updates. 

For example, the articles highlight the importance of limiting components within a system to maximize their reusability and ensure that there aren’t any components within the system that don’t have clear purpose, or overlap too significantly with another component’s functionality. Typefaces should also be chosen with careful consideration, limiting the number of variations in font, sizing, and other embellishments (such as bold or italic type) to create a more manageable set of options. Spacing should also have limited choices, such as a set increment system (such as in multiples of 8), both for visual consistency and for creating a clear rule. 

This is not unlike the function of menus in restaurants—limited options, all which follow defined recipes to be made and served to customers. Without a menu, much like a design system without these rules, there would be chaos as there would be limitless options, and no guidelines on how to fulfill each order.
