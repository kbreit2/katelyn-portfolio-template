# Portfolio and Design Narratives
## Reading from UXfolio

*Design is to a UI as clothes are to a person.*

A person's choice of fashion says a lot about them. Colors and styles convey detail about the wearer's personality and, in many professional contexts, determines if someone is taken seriously and if they're perceived to be taking the situation seriously. Since clothing is one of the first impressions we have of someone we're meeting, it tends to be emphasized greatly. Many of the same principles apply to UI. Color conveyances, typefaces, and so on are used to style a UI in a way that conveys something about the people behind it. It seems a common trend in UXfolio's collection of portfolio examples that many of them follow modern design conventions: sleek, clean, minimal in their palette, with splashes of color according to the designer's own tastes. Since a portfolio is used in professional contexts, and in many cases is a prospective employer's first impression of an applicant, it makes sense that these conventions emerge. It's much the same idea as wearing business attire to a job interview--it's an acknowledgement of the professional environment by following an established standard for that environment. Balancing a glimpse into the designer's character with the professional expectations of the format can be a difficult task, but when done with intentionality and moderation, a portfolio can have both professionalism and personality.

This person is clearly dressed professionally, but the red is a rare choice that conveys something about their personality. We can strive for much the same balance in a portfolio. From [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/search?k=job+interview&search_type=usertyped&asset_id=317001615)
