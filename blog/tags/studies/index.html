United Nations, is an exercise intended to give learning designers some hands-on experience thinking about inclusive design--and reckoning with some of the reasons so many UI fail in this regard. For the exercise, each member of the group was assigned a certain population, and tasked with researching and presenting their accessibility needs. Afterwards, the group would negotiate and prioritize the design requirements derived from these needs, and allocate a set amount of resources on which could be implemented into our hypothetical web design.</p>
<p>My group was color vision deficiency (CVD), better known as color blindness.</p>
<p>You can view the full presentation here:</p>
<table><iframe title="UIUN Color Vision Deficiency Presentation" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQ_6IVo7bonuABM50WZpxqvO0CMDc2XcWpeGLnNnFCHR8CXKieSt1bgRTjhfhcewHrY-3igWzkPsKLc/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=30000" frameborder="0" width="960" height="569" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe></table>
<p>My initial findings were that:</p>
<ul><li>CVD affects 4.5% of the population, or 300 million people globally.</li><li><p>There are many different types of CVD, which affect color perception differently.</p><ul><li>Most commonly, CVD affects the ability to discriminate between red and green.</li><li>Other types include tritanopia, which affects yellow vs pink, red vs purple, and blue vs green.</li><li>In rare cases, and associated with more significant visual impairments, someone may be completely unable to see in color.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>4.5% is a large number when we&#x27;re talking about a group that could potentially be excluded by poor design decisions. But, with the varying types of CVD, it was clear not everyone with it has the same experience--and, by extension, a solution that worked for one person with CVD would be unlikely to work for the entire population. What we needed was:</p>
<ul><li>Not to focus too much on the hues in use, since not everyone will perceive them the same way.</li><li>To focus on making design elements distinct, regardless of what hue they were perceived to be.</li><li>To give some additional cue if color is used to imply meaning.</li></ul>
<p>These principles translate fairly immediately into design ideas:</p>
<ul><li>Use additional, <em>meaningful</em> symbols, labels, etc. to accompany color cues.</li><li>Make sure the values of our colors contrast enough, so that regardless of the parent hue, they are clearly differentiated.</li></ul>
<p>I once spent several minutes trying to piece together why my code, which had compiled and was working as expected, had a red parentheses, the color that usually indicates a syntax error. After coming up with nothing, I eventually discovered that what I had perceived as read was simply a magenta color that appeared red due to my low screen brightness--it was simply meant to color code a match with its closing parentheses. Sufficient contrast, or an additional symbol besides color, could have avoided the confusion entirely. I don&#x27;t have CVD, and I could readily think of an instance where I would benefit from the same design changes that could help someone who does.</p>
<p>This revealed a strong underlying theme of this exercise. Inclusive design ideas don&#x27;t exclusively help people with disabilities--they&#x27;re often good considerations in general, helping a wide range of users beyond just the ones they were built for. For that reason, I was optimistic about the support I&#x27;d receive for my changes going into the negotiation process with my peers. I planned to emphasize color contrast within the values of the palette, since I expected non-color signifiers would not require much argument. I was prompt about prioritizing this aspect of the palette, and with a few additional requirements for colors or color combinations to favor or avoid being wrapped into the original (many of which came from our photosensitivity representative), I was able to secure both my major design suggestions here.</p>
<p>Overall, the negotiations went very smoothly. My peers seemed very mindful of the importance of all the design considerations presented, even ones that did not directly assist their population. I was most surprised by the overlap between myself and the non-native English speakers representative, as at first glance there wouldn&#x27;t appear to be much overlap between CVD and multilingual populations. However, acknowledging that many multilingual users are going to have different cultural backgrounds, it brought up the important consideration that the meanings of colors are not universal. People with CVD may miss color-indicated meanings due to a difference in how they perceive the colors, and people with different cultural backgrounds than a designer may miss the meaning because they have a different association with the color. For both, use of additional cues to suggest the content&#x27;s meaning would be beneficial. As for the groups that were hardest to convince, our representative of baby boomers diverged the most vocally from me. Though there were some places our populations&#x27; needs overlapped, such as having good color contrast, the areas where their needs diverged took many of our priorities elsewhere. She was advocating for things like screen reader support over something like non color-dependent cues.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that either of us acknowledge the usefulness of the other&#x27;s proposals, but with the limited resources we had to allocate to our final picks, our priorities conflicted. I felt bad about ignoring the suggestions of many others whose proposals did not match well with mine, or who had less support for their suggestions overall. Not a single one of my peers&#x27; ideas were without purpose, and all would be helpful inclusions for accessibility. It seems to match many common trends in web design overall, where the less visible accessibility requirements go neglected--and, thanks to that lack of accesibility, it&#x27;s not always simple for those populations to voice their needs to the people who could make these changes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this exercise gave me a lot to think about, and many principles to carry into my future designs. My major takeaways from the activity were:</p>
<ul><li>Inclusive design helps more people than just those the designer had in mind.</li><li>Inclusive design is effortful, and without careful consideration, some important requirements may go overlooked.</li><li>It&#x27;s a lot simpler to dedicate resources to following inclusive design principles from the beginning, instead of trying to find the resources to restructure things later on.</li></ul>

I like this image a lot, as I think it reflects one of my major takeaways from the exercise--that design choices often thought of as accessibility features often help usability in general.

<p>For this exercise, I visited my local art gallery, the Sheldon Museum of Art, to look over their collections in hopes of finding some inspiration for a UI design sketch. This piece, <em>Piazza Sigmund Freud (Milan, Italy)</em> by Lewis Baltz caught my eye. It is composed of three chromogenic prints that together show the parking lot of a railway station Lewis used during his time in Europe. Lewis saw an intensity in the unadulterated urban environment, unmistakably captured in the dramatic lighting of these photos.</p>

<p>The most immediately striking part of this piece was its colors. The photos are primarily red and black, with more maroon tones within the gradients between the two. Red-lit environments have been found to increase tension, depression, and anxiety compared to white-lit environments, and the shadowy nature of the vast darkness surrounding the area only intensifies these feelings. I found it fascinating that such a limited color palette could evoke such a vivid atmosphere.</p>

<p>I was drawn to this piece in part by its interesting use of negative space. An entire third of the triptych is negative space, with only a faint red-to-black gradient of the sky occupying the frame. This provides a sense of vastness: the cityscape itself seems large and sprawling, but the world around it is ever larger in a way that even the skyscrapers cannot match. The emptiness of the sky also contrasts visually with the business of the urban elements. Artist Adrian Reynolds explains that negative space has an emotional component of isolation and emptiness, which seems apt for this composition.</p>

<p>This piece is a triptych, one piece separated into three component pieces. The individual pieces are quite different in their contents--one is just the sky, one is just the parking lot, and one has a hilly area leading up to more parking. This is the intrigue of triptychs as an art form; though there is a throughline among the pieces, each individual section is also an independent piece, allowed its own unique identity. Grouping of components is an important consideration in UI design as well, and though a traditional triptych wasn&#x27;t what I envisioned for the UI, it got me thinking about the separation of different elements.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="The UI created." src="/katelyn-portfolio-template/assets/images/findingInspirationUI-0f54f2c09658c5c1a6cf5606ec4651df.png" width="1342" height="1196" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>In this UI, I hoped to replicate the intensity of the colors and the clever use of negative space. I used the photosâ color palette as a jumping off point, with black becoming my color for most components, red as the &quot;negative space&quot;, and white for text.</p>
<p>I brightened up the colors to make the UI a bit more friendly than the intense and even dangerous atmosphere of the photos by playing up the transitional maroon and having my reds lean a bit more pink so theyâd be perceived as gentler.</p>
<p>As for the negative space, I hoped to convey a sense of openness in this UI as the original photos achieved. I still tried to evoke a skyline with the gradient used as the background. I imagine in a full implementation there could be a subtle parallax effect as the user scrolls the page to the lower sections to enforce this idea of vastness.</p>
<p>The gradient also continues off to the side where I made the choice to have the section names not in the black portion, but atop the gradient, to match the contents they are shortcuts for. This was my attempt at playing with the grouping of elements, but instead of the original piece&#x27;s strict separation of its sections, I wanted to experiment with mine bleeding into each other. By being a part of the gradient, the sections still feel a part of the content they interact with.</p>
<p>I imagine this would be a UI for a company who wants a sleek but exciting look, perhaps something like an activewear brand. The white font on black text feels very modern, but the pinkish-red gradient has an energy that contrasts the restrained, minimal look of the simple black and white. This UI is intended for web devices, due to its reliance on horizontal width.</p>

<p>This exercise was a useful lesson in how getting out of your comfort zone introduces you to new design ideas. Admittedly, this piece wasnât the first one that caught my eye--I initially looked towards others that more closely suited my usual favorites in terms of colors especially. But, there was something boring and uninspired about the sketches produced from those. Looking for something new and striking pushed me in a constructive direction, and Iâm pleased with the result.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Experiments with or observations about UIs." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/katelyn-portfolio-template/blog/tags/studies">Studies</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/katelyn-portfolio-template/blog/physiology-gallery-walk">Physiology Gallery Walk</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-09-30T16:58:00.000Z">September 30, 2024</time> Â· <!-- -->One min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p>This page documents an activity where I, along with my design peers, did research on a concept of design physiology and/or psychology.

<p>This is the Google Drive UI, as seen by a browser user. It uses a primarily monochromatic palette of tones of blue, with the inclusion of white and (almost) black tones. Even the tones that appear gray are slightly blue-based. It also seems intentionally minimalistic, with its limited colors and significant use of white.</p>
<p>Blue, as discussed in <em>The Complete Color Harmony</em><sup><a id="user-content-fnref-1-f4c6aa" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="/katelyn-portfolio-template/blog/tags/studies#user-content-fn-1-f4c6aa">1</a></sup> is the most common color for UI design. For a utility app such as Drive, it seems to be a good choice. Calm is emphasized over excitement; nothing about using Drive demands much enthusiasm. It seems to strive for simplicity in both color and navigation. Blue is also a color associated with trustworthiness, a worthy concern for a product users trust to manage their files. I would expect the designers had exactly these goals in mind for what the UI would convey: calm, simplicity, and trust.</p>

This replica of the UI will be used to experiment with alternate color palettes. Generally, icons were simplified to open circles. The icons on the right hand side of the page were omitted as multiple of them are logos for other products. The multicolored Drive logo will remain an exception to the color palette, as with the original.</p>

For the first alternate palette, I wanted to experiment with value-driven colors. I kept the monochrome look of the original, but adjusted it to a color aligned with the functions of Drive. Drive enables communication, work, sociability, and creation, all traits associated with orange.</p>
<p>Orange is a departure from the original blue; to blueâs cool calmness, orange is close to the opposite, and can easily be seen as too much. Thus it was important to keep the brightness of this palette somewhat restrained in order to maintain the ease of viewing. Like the original, I freely allowed the use of white and black-adjacent tones to ensure this. The palette conveys more energy than the original, without becoming overwhelming.</p>
<p>This version of the palette was also a lesson in how colors appear differently on various screens. When viewing this on my phone screen, all the colors are undeniably orange. When viewed on my computer, the lighter tones appear almost pink. The romantic connotation of pink adds a much different feeling to the app than its intended orange shades do.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="A recolor of the Google Drive UI, using the primary colors (red, yellow, blue), white, and black." src="/katelyn-portfolio-template/assets/images/colorStudyPaletteII-3d6864540ecaa8bce9168e25f2d180f6.png" width="800" height="400" class="img_ev3q">
This palette was more of an exercise in what <em>not</em> to do. Most of Googleâs products have the primary colors (plus green) on their logo, including Drive. This palette is not carried into the products themselves, most of which also use monochrome, minimalist color palettes. To observe why Google did not fully embrace this design convention, I created a triadic palette using the three primary colors: red, yellow, and blue.</p>
<p>Red and blue serve as calls to action, indicating something that can be interacted with or demands attention. Red indicates the simplest interactions, banners or highlights that only require a single click. Given redâs psychological spurring to fast action, this felt appropriate. This also placed the reds near the less contrasting yellow instead of blue in most instances. Blue is reserved for more thoughtful actions, such as searching for an item, opening and selecting from one of the dropdowns, or opening one of the suggested folders. The yellow is unimposing compared to its counterparts, so it was a serviceable background color.</p>
<p>Itâs plain to see why Google kept their UIs less colorful. All the primaries together look busy and there is little meaning to be found within their clashing appearances and associations. The palette suggests something fun and unserious, quite the opposite of what the original conveys. Especially with the white included, itâs a palette that evokes clowns instead of a professional, simplistic utility app.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="A recolor of the Google Drive UI, using blue, blue-purple, and purple tones." src="/katelyn-portfolio-template/assets/images/colorStudyPaletteIII-79a32da831d009609c258aafbfb875ab.png" width="800" height="400" class="img_ev3q">
For the final recolor, I wanted to try an analogous color palette. I find the original blue fitting, but took notice that some of its blues leaned closer to green while others had purple undertones. Thus, I fully committed to one direction by incorporating blue-purple and purple alongside the blue in its palette. I also wanted to try a palette that doesnât use pure white as its âblankâ color.</p>
<p>I opted for purples due to their creative and perspective-seeking personality associations, which seemed in alignment with the functionality of Drive. This design should still convey simplicity and color harmony like the original, but should ideally have more visual interest and perhaps a more contemplative connotation. The brighter shades of purple used evoke the whimsy of lavender more than the refinement associated with darker purples. Like the original, the cool tones make it easy on the eye and not especially energetic, but the added purple does pop out. The prominence of the light blues, much more omnipresent than on the original, give a bit of an icy look to the interface.</p>
<p>Despite having roughly the same amount of colors as the original, thanks to the loss of white, it no longer looks minimalistic and instead has a playful quality to it without being distracting. Still, this design doesnât cast as wide a net as the original, lacking the mass appeal that a minimalist monochrome palette has.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusions">Conclusions<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusions" title="Direct link to Conclusions" href="/katelyn-portfolio-template/blog/tags/studies#conclusions">â</a></h3>
<p>An effective color palette should be both visually appealing and aligned with the app itself. So, which color scheme is ultimately the most effective? I believe the original best matches this definition, and this comes as no shock. A company with Googleâs reputation likely went through an extensive experimentation process of their own before landing on this design, and itâs easy to see why itâs appealing. The simplicity of it reflects the simplicity of the app, the calming blue is usually a safe choice, and the minimalistic color usage doesn&#x27;t risk upsetting anyone&#x27;s personal tastes.</p>
<p>Of my own takes, I would say my monochrome orange is the best substitute. I enjoy the energy it provides the app, and I think the connotations of the color are reflective of the values this app helps people live out. There is something to be said about the diversified palettes, but at the end of the day each palette has a time and place, and in an app of Driveâs nature, less is usually more.</p>
