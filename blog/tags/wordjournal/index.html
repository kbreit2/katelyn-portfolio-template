<p>Interviews are a notoriously daunting process for many, especially those just starting out in an industry or any professional environment. To summarize the process in a single word, with all the preparation and knowledge that goes into a successful interview, is a difficult task. But in the context of a design interview, I believe perspective is the single most important concept to consider.</p>
<p>After watching these three videos from people with experience in the design industry, and seeing their advice for interviewees, I was unsurprised by many of the common threads: being self-aware, articulate, concise, and simply prepared were clearly emphasized. But I was more surprised by the unspoken undertone of many of those principles: being able to present and expand your perspective. A successful interview should be able to tell the interviewer what kind of person you would be to work with. Being able to articulate how you think, your process, and challenges you&#x27;ve overcome is a good way to illustrate your adaptability, and how they could expect you to respond to similar situations in their work environment. Being self-reflective, and demonstrating that you&#x27;ve been able to progress and learn from your mistakes is also valued--many interviewees get too caught up in fear of presenting themself as capable of mistakes to convey this effectively. And illustrating that same curiosity, building your perspective of what your work experience would be like if you were hired, is not just good for your own understanding, but is often appreciated by interviewers who want to see your passion and thoughtfulness about the position; they want you to want the job, and that usually requires a deep understanding of what that job truly means.</p>

<p><em>Options</em> is a word that embodies the concepts of this chapter. Inclusive design can be a tricky problem since not all users have the same needs, and something that may be useful to one person might actively disrupt another. This issue, along with the time and resources involved in making a website widely accessible, are commonly blamed for why designers don&#x27;t pursue accessibility options. But in modern design, where we have conveniences like accessibility menus that allow people to customize the features that best assist their experince, there&#x27;s little need to attempt to respond to everyone&#x27;s needs in a singular interface. By including different options to adjust the same base experience, we can allow users to individualize their experience.</p>
<p>Creating these options does still take resources on the designers&#x27; part, but it is a worthy effort to allow the most people possible to use a site comfortably. If enough people are willing to undertake that effort, we can make a more widely accessible internet, and perhaps contribute to even more tools along the way that can make accessibility features simpler to implement. The amount of accessibility-related resources readily available to developers has already increased greatly from the past. Krug offers easy starting points, like fixing widespread use issues, doing research on accessible web design, and starting with small things like alt text, clear heading structure, and color contrast to fix a few common accessibility issues.</p>

<p><em>Hierarchy</em> is a word that embodies both the navigation and values components of this reading.</p>
<p>Krug’s discussion of navigation heavily emphasizes hierarchy. It is crucial for a viewer to know where they are within a site, an especially difficult task given the relative unknowns of navigating a website compared to a physical environment. Thus, hierarchy helps direct where users are and where they can get to from that point. Users’ choices when navigating a website are usually snap judgments with little conscious thought, so helping to inform those by providing a visual indicator of the organization flow of the website can lead to more accurate choices and less opportunities to get lost. Several of Krug’s major questions to ask about website navigation, including the page’s major sections, options at the current level, and position in the scheme of things, are logically embodied by a hierarchy, and a UI is well-served by reflecting that internal logic through its visual construction.</p>
<p>Hierarchy is also important in conversations of values. Colin Breck describes the likely problem that a company will resonate with many core values, but must limit its key values in order to adhere to them fully. Specifically, the text describes “second-tier” values that are encompassed within the two core values selected by a company.</p>

<p><strong>Balance</strong>. This word describes the principles found in the section of the text that describes the three outlying design principles (i.e. not the big four). In practice, this means careful consideration of the interplay between design elements and how a designer should strive to achieve something that conveys the appropriate amount of information, in a sensible way, with the appropriate amount of embellishment. For example, the signal-to-noise ratio relates to the amount of signals on a design (i.e. information with some crucial purpose) versus noise (anything on the design which is not conveying information). Reynolds suggests trying to achieve the highest ratio possible, such that the signals far outweigh the noise in a contained design. Balance can also be considered in less obvious aspects of design, such as in the use of images. As described in the picture superiority effect, people more readily remember words than images–we should strive not to overwhelm users with descriptive text that could have its effect achieved much more simply by an image. At the same time, text is not without place, and can be used to label or relate images. Spacing is also another aspect of design where balance is key. Empty space has a place in design, both to avoid overcrowding of information, and to enable grouping of related elements through differential spacing.</p>

<p>I chose this image to represent the signal-to-noise ratio. The stacked stones may represent units of signal, while the singular stone represents noise. A lot of signal is best to balance out any noise.

<p>For this chapter I chose the word <strong>intuitiveness</strong>. This term is especially relevant to the section on Human-Centered Design, but I believe it’s also a common thread among the design principles described in the entire chapter. A well-designed object is easy to use, with its intended affordances and the means to achieve those affordances signified without much conscious effort on the user&#x27;s part. Many designs fail to be immediately understandable by a user, such as the Norman doors the author describes that lack common cues such as handles or visible hinges. Adding signifiers may help to fill gaps in a user’s intuition. Understanding what makes sense to human users allows for a product to serve its purpose in a streamlined manner. This concept is crucial to remember in my career in design because a design that is not intuitive risks losing the patience and favor of its users, without whom a product is useless. Making a product easy to use elevates the user&#x27;s experience and can provide an edge over competing products that may not have taken the user’s intuitive behaviors and assumptions into consideration. Where well-chosen embellishments may make a user’s experience actively positive, intuitive ones should ensure it isn’t negative.</p>

Signs on each door have a cartoon rendition of a person running from a fire, with text that reads &amp;quot;DO NOT BLOCK FIRE EXITS&amp;quot;.

<p>I looked for an example of a door to analyze its signifiers and how intuitive it would be to open. The extruding bars on the doors signify they can be pushed. The fire exit cues, both the text and the imagery of someone fleeing a fire, are also signifiers for this door&#x27;s specific use case. The relatively unusual shape of the bars for a door (thinner and stretching further out than I&#x27;ve typically seen) might also be an intentional design choice as it gives a user pause before using a door that is only intended for situational use. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeepersmedia/49399118683/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Original Image (no modifications were made)</a></p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Choose a section of the reading and summarize it in a single word.
