# User Testing
## Reading from Steven Krug's *Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability* Chapters 8 and 9, and Don Norman's *The Design of Everyday Things* Chapter 5


These readings go into depth on the nature of user testing, and the nature of mistakes within a UI. 

*Don’t Make Me Think* covers the benefits and general flow of user testing. User testing allows us to gain insights from people with distance from the project–the designers, too used to their own system, can easily overlook issues entirely, leading to problems if they assume this means no issues remain. User testing does not need to be expensive, or even especially formal beyond following a general script and gaining consent for recording. Generally, the user will be told about the process, introduced to the home page, then given tasks to attempt on the site. The proctor will watch them perform these tasks, and the user will attempt to narrate their thought process, so that we can better understand what goes through the user’s mind as they navigate (or fail to) through the task. 

*The Design of Everyday Things* gives us some guidance on how we should respond to user mistakes that were identified in testing. It is very rarely (but not never) the fault of a human when an error occurs. In most cases, were we to improve our design by giving better signifiers or feedback, accounting for possible mistakes, and so on, we could have prevented the error entirely. User testing allows us to uncover such mistakes and adjust our system accordingly.

This section got me thinking about a design consideration that has been more in the public eye recently–the shift to digital UI in cars. Concerns have been expressed both by the public and regulatory agencies about the safety of digital interfaces, which draw users’ attention away from the road for more sustained periods than a traditional car function, like a knob to change speaker volume, is expected to. 

Tesla has been at the forefront of digitizing vehicles. I referenced the images in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxEteR7myno) to analyze their UI. The UI does retain many established signifiers of analog interfaces, such as the speaker icons to indicate where volume controls are located and heating icons for temperature adjustment. However, aside from the basic functionalities of a car, it is difficult to guess where more advanced functions would be tucked away. The same argument could be made for a traditional interface, but due to the all-inclusive nature of the screen display, I suspect many users would be inclined to spend more time searching than they would parsing traditional buttons or knobs. 

The video also references Elon Musk’s idea that all inputs are a mistake, which seems like a radical expansion on the ideas expressed in *The Design of Everyday Things* that it is rarely a human user’s fault when something goes wrong, but an underlying flaw in the system. Musk’s idea is something more akin to any dependency on human interaction is an error in the system. Making a system operate as independently from a user as possible would remove the human error excuse, but it will also unveil the flaws within the system itself.

The prominence of touch-screen tablets has had an effect on design conventions, such as the popularization of screen displays for cars.
