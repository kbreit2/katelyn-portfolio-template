<p>For this exercise, I visited my local art gallery, the Sheldon Museum of Art, to look over their collections in hopes of finding some inspiration for a UI design sketch. This piece, <em>Piazza Sigmund Freud (Milan, Italy)</em> by Lewis Baltz caught my eye. It is composed of three chromogenic prints that together show the parking lot of a railway station Lewis used during his time in Europe. Lewis saw an intensity in the unadulterated urban environment, unmistakably captured in the dramatic lighting of these photos.</p>

<p>The most immediately striking part of this piece was its colors. The photos are primarily red and black, with more maroon tones within the gradients between the two. Red-lit environments have been found to increase tension, depression, and anxiety compared to white-lit environments, and the shadowy nature of the vast darkness surrounding the area only intensifies these feelings. I found it fascinating that such a limited color palette could evoke such a vivid atmosphere.</p>

<p>I was drawn to this piece in part by its interesting use of negative space. An entire third of the triptych is negative space, with only a faint red-to-black gradient of the sky occupying the frame. This provides a sense of vastness: the cityscape itself seems large and sprawling, but the world around it is ever larger in a way that even the skyscrapers cannot match. The emptiness of the sky also contrasts visually with the business of the urban elements. Artist Adrian Reynolds explains that negative space has an emotional component of isolation and emptiness, which seems apt for this composition.</p>

<p>This piece is a triptych, one piece separated into three component pieces. The individual pieces are quite different in their contents--one is just the sky, one is just the parking lot, and one has a hilly area leading up to more parking. This is the intrigue of triptychs as an art form; though there is a throughline among the pieces, each individual section is also an independent piece, allowed its own unique identity. Grouping of components is an important consideration in UI design as well, and though a traditional triptych wasn&#x27;t what I envisioned for the UI, it got me thinking about the separation of different elements.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-ui">My UI<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to My UI" title="Direct link to My UI" href="/katelyn-portfolio-template/blog/page/2#my-ui">​</a></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="The UI created." src="/katelyn-portfolio-template/assets/images/findingInspirationUI-0f54f2c09658c5c1a6cf5606ec4651df.png" width="1342" height="1196" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>In this UI, I hoped to replicate the intensity of the colors and the clever use of negative space. I used the photos’ color palette as a jumping off point, with black becoming my color for most components, red as the &quot;negative space&quot;, and white for text.</p>
<p>I brightened up the colors to make the UI a bit more friendly than the intense and even dangerous atmosphere of the photos by playing up the transitional maroon and having my reds lean a bit more pink so they’d be perceived as gentler.</p>
<p>As for the negative space, I hoped to convey a sense of openness in this UI as the original photos achieved. I still tried to evoke a skyline with the gradient used as the background. I imagine in a full implementation there could be a subtle parallax effect as the user scrolls the page to the lower sections to enforce this idea of vastness.</p>
<p>The gradient also continues off to the side where I made the choice to have the section names not in the black portion, but atop the gradient, to match the contents they are shortcuts for. This was my attempt at playing with the grouping of elements, but instead of the original piece&#x27;s strict separation of its sections, I wanted to experiment with mine bleeding into each other. By being a part of the gradient, the sections still feel a part of the content they interact with.</p>
<p>I imagine this would be a UI for a company who wants a sleek but exciting look, perhaps something like an activewear brand. The white font on black text feels very modern, but the pinkish-red gradient has an energy that contrasts the restrained, minimal look of the simple black and white. This UI is intended for web devices, due to its reliance on horizontal width.</p>

<p>This exercise was a useful lesson in how getting out of your comfort zone introduces you to new design ideas. Admittedly, this piece wasn’t the first one that caught my eye--I initially looked towards others that more closely suited my usual favorites in terms of colors especially. But, there was something boring and uninspired about the sketches produced from those. Looking for something new and striking pushed me in a constructive direction, and I’m pleased with the result.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Experiments with or observations about UIs." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/katelyn-portfolio-template/blog/tags/studies">Studies</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/katelyn-portfolio-template/blog/design-systems">Design Systems</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-10-04T16:58:00.000Z">October 4, 2024</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="readings-from-figma">Readings from Figma<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Readings from Figma" title="Direct link to Readings from Figma" href="/katelyn-portfolio-template/blog/page/2#readings-from-figma">​</a></h2>
<p><em>Restraint is to design systems as menus are to restaurants.</em></p>
<p>The overarching theme of these articles is the importance of restraint in design systems. Keeping things simple may lead to sacrificing levels of detail that may seem undesirable at the time, but will make for easier management of the system moving forward. The more prescriptive the options are, the easier the rules are to follow, and the easier it is to make updates.</p>
<p>For example, the articles highlight the importance of limiting components within a system to maximize their reusability and ensure that there aren’t any components within the system that don’t have clear purpose, or overlap too significantly with another component’s functionality. Typefaces should also be chosen with careful consideration, limiting the number of variations in font, sizing, and other embellishments (such as bold or italic type) to create a more manageable set of options. Spacing should also have limited choices, such as a set increment system (such as in multiples of 8), both for visual consistency and for creating a clear rule.</p>
<p>This is not unlike the function of menus in restaurants—limited options, all which follow defined recipes to be made and served to customers. Without a menu, much like a design system without these rules, there would be chaos as there would be limitless options, and no guidelines on how to fulfill each order.</p>

<p>This is the Google Drive UI, as seen by a browser user. It uses a primarily monochromatic palette of tones of blue, with the inclusion of white and (almost) black tones. Even the tones that appear gray are slightly blue-based. It also seems intentionally minimalistic, with its limited colors and significant use of white.</p>
<p>Blue, as discussed in <em>The Complete Color Harmony</em><sup><a id="user-content-fnref-1-f4c6aa" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="/katelyn-portfolio-template/blog/page/2#user-content-fn-1-f4c6aa">1</a></sup> is the most common color for UI design. For a utility app such as Drive, it seems to be a good choice. Calm is emphasized over excitement; nothing about using Drive demands much enthusiasm. It seems to strive for simplicity in both color and navigation. Blue is also a color associated with trustworthiness, a worthy concern for a product users trust to manage their files. I would expect the designers had exactly these goals in mind for what the UI would convey: calm, simplicity, and trust.</p>

This replica of the UI will be used to experiment with alternate color palettes. Generally, icons were simplified to open circles. The icons on the right hand side of the page were omitted as multiple of them are logos for other products. The multicolored Drive logo will remain an exception to the color palette, as with the original.</p>

For the first alternate palette, I wanted to experiment with value-driven colors. I kept the monochrome look of the original, but adjusted it to a color aligned with the functions of Drive. Drive enables communication, work, sociability, and creation, all traits associated with orange.</p>
<p>Orange is a departure from the original blue; to blue’s cool calmness, orange is close to the opposite, and can easily be seen as too much. Thus it was important to keep the brightness of this palette somewhat restrained in order to maintain the ease of viewing. Like the original, I freely allowed the use of white and black-adjacent tones to ensure this. The palette conveys more energy than the original, without becoming overwhelming.</p>
<p>This version of the palette was also a lesson in how colors appear differently on various screens. When viewing this on my phone screen, all the colors are undeniably orange. When viewed on my computer, the lighter tones appear almost pink. The romantic connotation of pink adds a much different feeling to the app than its intended orange shades do.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="A recolor of the Google Drive UI, using the primary colors (red, yellow, blue), white, and black." src="/katelyn-portfolio-template/assets/images/colorStudyPaletteII-3d6864540ecaa8bce9168e25f2d180f6.png" width="800" height="400" class="img_ev3q">
This palette was more of an exercise in what <em>not</em> to do. Most of Google’s products have the primary colors (plus green) on their logo, including Drive. This palette is not carried into the products themselves, most of which also use monochrome, minimalist color palettes. To observe why Google did not fully embrace this design convention, I created a triadic palette using the three primary colors: red, yellow, and blue.</p>
<p>Red and blue serve as calls to action, indicating something that can be interacted with or demands attention. Red indicates the simplest interactions, banners or highlights that only require a single click. Given red’s psychological spurring to fast action, this felt appropriate. This also placed the reds near the less contrasting yellow instead of blue in most instances. Blue is reserved for more thoughtful actions, such as searching for an item, opening and selecting from one of the dropdowns, or opening one of the suggested folders. The yellow is unimposing compared to its counterparts, so it was a serviceable background color.</p>
<p>It’s plain to see why Google kept their UIs less colorful. All the primaries together look busy and there is little meaning to be found within their clashing appearances and associations. The palette suggests something fun and unserious, quite the opposite of what the original conveys. Especially with the white included, it’s a palette that evokes clowns instead of a professional, simplistic utility app.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="alternate-palette-iii-icy-analogous">Alternate Palette III: Icy Analogous<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Alternate Palette III: Icy Analogous" title="Direct link to Alternate Palette III: Icy Analogous" href="/katelyn-portfolio-template/blog/page/2#alternate-palette-iii-icy-analogous">​</a></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="A recolor of the Google Drive UI, using blue, blue-purple, and purple tones." src="/katelyn-portfolio-template/assets/images/colorStudyPaletteIII-79a32da831d009609c258aafbfb875ab.png" width="800" height="400" class="img_ev3q">
For the final recolor, I wanted to try an analogous color palette. I find the original blue fitting, but took notice that some of its blues leaned closer to green while others had purple undertones. Thus, I fully committed to one direction by incorporating blue-purple and purple alongside the blue in its palette. I also wanted to try a palette that doesn’t use pure white as its “blank” color.</p>
<p>I opted for purples due to their creative and perspective-seeking personality associations, which seemed in alignment with the functionality of Drive. This design should still convey simplicity and color harmony like the original, but should ideally have more visual interest and perhaps a more contemplative connotation. The brighter shades of purple used evoke the whimsy of lavender more than the refinement associated with darker purples. Like the original, the cool tones make it easy on the eye and not especially energetic, but the added purple does pop out. The prominence of the light blues, much more omnipresent than on the original, give a bit of an icy look to the interface.</p>
<p>Despite having roughly the same amount of colors as the original, thanks to the loss of white, it no longer looks minimalistic and instead has a playful quality to it without being distracting. Still, this design doesn’t cast as wide a net as the original, lacking the mass appeal that a minimalist monochrome palette has.</p>

<p>An effective color palette should be both visually appealing and aligned with the app itself. So, which color scheme is ultimately the most effective? I believe the original best matches this definition, and this comes as no shock. A company with Google’s reputation likely went through an extensive experimentation process of their own before landing on this design, and it’s easy to see why it’s appealing. The simplicity of it reflects the simplicity of the app, the calming blue is usually a safe choice, and the minimalistic color usage doesn&#x27;t risk upsetting anyone&#x27;s personal tastes.</p>
<p>Of my own takes, I would say my monochrome orange is the best substitute. I enjoy the energy it provides the app, and I think the connotations of the color are reflective of the values this app helps people live out. There is something to be said about the diversified palettes, but at the end of the day each palette has a time and place, and in an app of Drive’s nature, less is usually more.</p>

<p>This section of reading covers both the conveyances of colors, and discusses the psychological ideas of what someone’s preferences in colors mean for their personality. Given the bulk of information, I decided to make myself a visual reference guide to lay out the information in a summarized manner. I chose to design this like a poster, or the concept art for what could be developed into one. I broke the drawing up into color zones where, in words, I wrote the associations of the respective color. For the personal color related information, I summarized the suggestions into a quick character drawing to accompany each section of the diagram, where the expression and pose of the character aim to convey what the reading suggests are characteristics of fans of the color. Beige is omitted from this poster due to the psychological overlap with brown, and the conveyance overlap with gray (and other neutrals). I wanted to have this so that I could see all the features of the colors side by side when considering color choices in my own works.</p>

<p>This section introduced some fundamental principles of color, including vocabulary such as hue, saturation, value, tone, and undertone. It also discussed the interplay between colors within palettes. The color wheel serves as an easy visual reference for the relationships between the colors, from which we can obtain several conventions for color combinations.</p>
<p>A monotone palette consists of a neutral color (off-white, gray, beige, etc.) in varying tones.</p>
<p>A monochrome palette is varying shades of a non-neutral hue (red, yellow, blue, etc.).</p>
<p>An analogous palette uses three adjacent families on the color wheel, most popularly a primary (red, yellow, blue), secondary (orange, green, purple), and a tertiary (red purple, orange red, yellow orange, yellow green, blue green, and blue purple) that all sit adjacent on the wheel.</p>
<p>Complementary color schemes make use of colors opposite each other on the wheel, and may include a neutral buffer. This can further be split into split complementary (a hue and the two on either side of its complement), triads (three equidistant hues on the wheel), or tetrads (two sets of complements for four total colors).</p>
<p>I found the discussion on palette selection especially interesting, so I wanted to test them out for myself by making different palettes for the same simple UI that satisfied each of the major categories (monotone, monochrome, analogous, and complementary).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="A set of four clones of the same simple UI that have been given varying color palettes: one with varying tones of beige; one with varying tones of green; one with blue, green, and blue-green; and one that is beige, orange, and blue." src="/katelyn-portfolio-template/assets/images/colorsIsketches-e42fdc770076ae9a4fe0dd721d37955c.png" width="512" height="512" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>For simplicity, this UI is just a generic header and footer, designed to have 3 colors in their shared palette (plus white for the negative space).</p>
<p>The monotone attempt is just varying shades of beige. Like the text predicts, it’s inoffensive, but not eye catching and does little to hold my interest, especially next to its more colorful counterparts.</p>
<p>The monochrome version is elevated by its pop of color, but the lack of contrast still leaves something to be desired. I find my eye drawn toward others before it.</p>
<p>Analogous is my personal favorite of the bunch. Next to the blue-green intermediary, both the blue and green used here take on a bit of the other color, leading to a more seamless look. This one also required the most experimentation, where I found that the blue or green didn’t look right as the dropdown color because the contrast became much more apparent when they were side by side.</p>
<p>For complementary, I used an orange and blue combination, along with a neutral buffer color like the text suggests. This makes the design more tame and prevents the visual vibration where the colors would otherwise overlap. Next to orange, the beige appears warmer than it does in the monotone version (it’s the exact same color!), so the blue of the text doesn’t lose its contrasting effect despite the buffer. Still, the warm orange seems to draw attention more quickly than the blue used for the text.</p>

<p><strong>Balance</strong>. This word describes the principles found in the section of the text that describes the three outlying design principles (i.e. not the big four). In practice, this means careful consideration of the interplay between design elements and how a designer should strive to achieve something that conveys the appropriate amount of information, in a sensible way, with the appropriate amount of embellishment. For example, the signal-to-noise ratio relates to the amount of signals on a design (i.e. information with some crucial purpose) versus noise (anything on the design which is not conveying information). Reynolds suggests trying to achieve the highest ratio possible, such that the signals far outweigh the noise in a contained design. Balance can also be considered in less obvious aspects of design, such as in the use of images. As described in the picture superiority effect, people more readily remember words than images–we should strive not to overwhelm users with descriptive text that could have its effect achieved much more simply by an image. At the same time, text is not without place, and can be used to label or relate images. Spacing is also another aspect of design where balance is key. Empty space has a place in design, both to avoid overcrowding of information, and to enable grouping of related elements through differential spacing.</p>

<p><strong>Information without intentionality is like a library without an organization system.</strong> If there is no organization scheme to the books in a library, it would be nearly impossible for someone to find what they were searching for. They would be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information with little distinction between each item. Even the books’ diversity in sizes, colors, and fonts would become overstimulating and difficult to parse through with such a large collection. Most people wouldn’t know where to start–or have the patience to even try.</p>
<p>The messaging in these chapters of Krug’s writing is that the same idea goes for UI design, where information should have clear intent and organization behind it. Walls of text, despite their higher word counts, ultimately give less information to a user who typically won’t devote the time or effort to anything more than skimming a site. A design tailored to emphasize the information that matters and eliminate that which has no purpose will serve much like an organization system in a library, allowing users to understand what information is where and, among that information, what is of interest to them.</p>
<p>Visual hierarchies, elimination of unnecessary words, and sparing use of visual indicators like animations or bold, large fonts are just a few of the ways to achieve this effect. Library organizational systems, much like design conventions, are usually well-established and should only be overturned in favor of something that clearly works better. To change something in a way that goes against the expectations of a user without improving their experience only adds more confusion.</p>

<p>This section of reading focused on data visualization and organization, particularly emphasizing the idea that a good UI should begin with an overview, enable zooming and filtering, and provide details to users on demand. This ensures that the information a user is given is tailored to what they came for, without the distractions of irrelevant information. Tools like keeping an action history can also aid users in navigating a UI, especially if they want to save the filters they applied, or go back to choose new details to demand. I chose to examine the <a href="https://maps.unl.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UNL campus map website</a> as an example of this UI philosophy, which I consider to be a functional if not especially appealing UI design. By default, this displays a very zoomed out version of the map where all the campuses are visible, with the shapes of relevant buildings displayed but no additional information on the significance of any individual building (overview). Clicking on one of the campuses, using the zoom tools on the side of the map, or searching for a building by name or abbreviation will narrow the field of view (zoom/filter). Only by confirming your interest by clicking on or searching for an individual building, then clicking on the “Get Directions” prompt, will a user be redirected to a tailored route between their location and the desired building (details on demand). This is also a usage of Shneiderman’s basic example of a 2-dimensional data display for a geographic map. It doesn’t follow all of Shneiderman’s advice, though: the system of undoing actions is fairly broken, only really able to achieve combining the previous and current terms in the search bar.</p>

<p>To start off my flow chart, I replicated the flow of stages of action as described in the textbook. Circles around the subsets of stages separate the gulf of execution and the gulf of evaluation. From there, I tried to tie in concepts from the previous chapter by applying the principles of design to these stages. The textbook is more detailed about the role of feedback in the evaluation stage, as it gives users information with which to make their evaluations. The text spent most of its time emphasizing signifiers as a means of feedforward, the information used to guide our execution. In addition to those signifiers, I noted down conceptual models and (logical) mappings as tools users might reflect on in this stage to plan their interaction with the item. I also denoted the outcomes that may occur once a goal has been attempted (i.e. the compare phase is over). If a user struggles to use an item or cannot figure out how to revise their behavior, they may experience learned helplessness and blame themself for the designer’s poor design choices. If given the right information, they will hopefully have a positive user experience with the item in question. This flowchart optimistically leaves off what happens if a user simply has a bad experience without blaming themself.</p>

<p>I was looking for an image to convey the sense of learned helplessness that can come from failure to grasp a design that lacks proper feedback. This image portrays someone wearing an electronic watch, which reminded me of the section in the text where the author muses about how watches are housing an increasing amount of functions and becoming less straightforward to use in the process. So, this image represents the learned helplessness you might experience if you cannot intuit how to navigate your e-watch. <a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/man-depressed-sitting-on-the-floor-2734073/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Original Image</a></p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Represent a set of concepts from the reading in a concept map and describe the relationships." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/katelyn-portfolio-template/blog/tags/conceptmap">ConceptMap</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/katelyn-portfolio-template/blog"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Newer Entries</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/katelyn-portfolio-template/blog/page/3"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">About Me</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/katelyn-portfolio-template/about-me">About Me</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Projects</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/katelyn-portfolio-template/projects">Projects</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Blog</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/katelyn-portfolio-template/blog">Blog</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/kbreit2/katelyn-portfolio-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2024 Katelyn's UI Portfolio.
