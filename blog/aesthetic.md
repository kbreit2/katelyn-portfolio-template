# Aesthetic Design
## Reading from Garr Reynolds's *Presentation Zen: Simple Ideas on Presentation Design and Delivery* Chapter 6

**Balance**. This word describes the principles found in the section of the text that describes the three outlying design principles (i.e. not the big four). In practice, this means careful consideration of the interplay between design elements and how a designer should strive to achieve something that conveys the appropriate amount of information, in a sensible way, with the appropriate amount of embellishment. For example, the signal-to-noise ratio relates to the amount of signals on a design (i.e. information with some crucial purpose) versus noise (anything on the design which is not conveying information). Reynolds suggests trying to achieve the highest ratio possible, such that the signals far outweigh the noise in a contained design. Balance can also be considered in less obvious aspects of design, such as in the use of images. As described in the picture superiority effect, people more readily remember words than imagesâ€“we should strive not to overwhelm users with descriptive text that could have its effect achieved much more simply by an image. At the same time, text is not without place, and can be used to label or relate images. Spacing is also another aspect of design where balance is key. Empty space has a place in design, both to avoid overcrowding of information, and to enable grouping of related elements through differential spacing.

I chose this image to represent the signal-to-noise ratio. The stacked stones may represent units of signal, while the singular stone represents noise. A lot of signal is best to balance out any noise.
