# Design Rules
## Reading from Steven Krug's *Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability* Chapters 2-5


**Information without intentionality is like a library without an organization system.** If there is no organization scheme to the books in a library, it would be nearly impossible for someone to find what they were searching for. They would be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information with little distinction between each item. Even the books’ diversity in sizes, colors, and fonts would become overstimulating and difficult to parse through with such a large collection. Most people wouldn’t know where to start–or have the patience to even try. 

The messaging in these chapters of Krug’s writing is that the same idea goes for UI design, where information should have clear intent and organization behind it. Walls of text, despite their higher word counts, ultimately give less information to a user who typically won’t devote the time or effort to anything more than skimming a site. A design tailored to emphasize the information that matters and eliminate that which has no purpose will serve much like an organization system in a library, allowing users to understand what information is where and, among that information, what is of interest to them. 

Visual hierarchies, elimination of unnecessary words, and sparing use of visual indicators like animations or bold, large fonts are just a few of the ways to achieve this effect. Library organizational systems, much like design conventions, are usually well-established and should only be overturned in favor of something that clearly works better. To change something in a way that goes against the expectations of a user without improving their experience only adds more confusion.

Much like a UI design, if I don’t have a sense of how these books are organized, I won’t be able to find the information I came for. None of the books so much as stand out to give me any sense of where to look. [Original Image (no modifications were made)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stewart/99129170/).
