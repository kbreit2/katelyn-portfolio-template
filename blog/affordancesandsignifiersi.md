# Affordances & Signifiers I
## Reading from Don Norman's *The Design of Everyday Things* Chapter 1

For this chapter I chose the word **intuitiveness**. This term is especially relevant to the section on Human-Centered Design, but I believe it’s also a common thread among the design principles described in the entire chapter. A well-designed object is easy to use, with its intended affordances and the means to achieve those affordances signified without much conscious effort on the user's part. Many designs fail to be immediately understandable by a user, such as the Norman doors the author describes that lack common cues such as handles or visible hinges. Adding signifiers may help to fill gaps in a user’s intuition. Understanding what makes sense to human users allows for a product to serve its purpose in a streamlined manner. This concept is crucial to remember in my career in design because a design that is not intuitive risks losing the patience and favor of its users, without whom a product is useless. Making a product easy to use elevates the user's experience and can provide an edge over competing products that may not have taken the user’s intuitive behaviors and assumptions into consideration. Where well-chosen embellishments may make a user’s experience actively positive, intuitive ones should ensure it isn’t negative.

![An image of a pair of fire exit doors. Signs on each door have a cartoon rendition of a person running from a fire, with text that reads "DO NOT BLOCK FIRE EXITS". On each door is a protruding handle that suggests a user must push them to open the door. The handles have "EMERGENCY EXIT" printed on them, as well as smaller text confirming the handles can be pushed.](./images/AffordancesandSignifiersIimage.jpg)

I looked for an example of a door to analyze its signifiers and how intuitive it would be to open. The extruding bars on the doors signify they can be pushed. The fire exit cues, both the text and the imagery of someone fleeing a fire, are also signifiers for this door's specific use case. The relatively unusual shape of the bars for a door (thinner and stretching further out than I've typically seen) might also be an intentional design choice as it gives a user pause before using a door that is only intended for situational use.
