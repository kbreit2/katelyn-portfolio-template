# Inclusive Design II
## Reading Don Norman's *The Design of Everyday Things* Chapter 4

*Constraints are to design as laws are to society.*

The many constraints we place within a design are a powerful tool in conveying how it is used. As Norman elaborates in this chapter, laws themselves are a form of cultural constraint. 

Physical constraints limit what can be physically done with a thing, such as inserting an object into something or connecting two objects at a specific point. These are a useful way to deter incorrect actions and imply the correct ones, especially when they are clearly communicated, which can be done even in simple ways like through an object's physical structure. 

Cultural constraints refer to the limits of our thinking within a cultural context. Some behaviors or symbols might be commonplace in one part of the world, but mean nothing at all, or something entirely different, in others. Cultural constraints limit a user's ability to interact with something, and may also limit a designer's ability to think about the universality of a design. 

Semantic constraints refer to the context of a situation. Given the context and ultimate goals of an individual design, some operations may be more intuitive than they would be in another context. 

Logical constraints are deductions a user can make, such as pieces of text going with the most adjacent heading. 

All these constraints in total provide order to a design, but they can be difficult to balance, and due to their lack of universality can create accessibility issues as not all users will understand them the same way. Thus, it is important for any designer to have an understanding of how a wide variety of users will process different constraints.
